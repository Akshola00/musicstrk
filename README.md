# MusicStrk: Autonomous On-Chain Record Label Solution (on Starknet)

## Project Overview

This open-source project aims to revolutionize the music industry by empowering indie artists through an autonomous on-chain record label solution built on **Starknet**. The project introduces a decentralized framework for artists to manage their music careers transparently while providing fans, investors, and enthusiasts with a stake in the artist's success.

## Key Features

### 1. **On-Chain Record Label**
Indie artists can create their personalized on-chain record label through a **smart contract**, defining their terms and conditions for collaboration, revenue sharing, and more.

### 2. **Decentralized Whitepaper (deWhitepaper)**
The **deWhitepaper** serves as a standard for the artist's record terms. It includes:
- **Share Selling**: Allows artists to raise funds for album development by selling shares to **degens, fans, and investors**.
- **Budget Transparency**: Outlines how raised funds will be used for:
  - Album promotions
  - Logistics
  - Studio sessions
  - Other development needs
- **Revenue Distribution**: Provides a clear breakdown of revenue streams, including:
  - Ticket sales
  - Royalties
  - Merchandise sales
  - Master and sync licensing fees
  - Endorsement deals

### 3. **Revenue Pool Access**
Shareholders receive a percentage of the revenue generated by the artist based on their shareholding. Revenue sharing lasts for the duration defined in the deWhitepaper:
- **Album Lifecycle**: Revenue is shared until the album's lifecycle concludes.
- **Time-Based Terms**: Contracts may specify a fixed number of years before expiration.

### 4. **Personalized Webspace & Other UI**
Artists will be given a personal webspace to represent their on-chain record label:
- Default URL: `[artist-username].musicstrk.fun`
- Option to upgrade to a custom domain
- E2E user features:
  - Ticketing sales section
  - Discography & DSP
  - Contact us page
  - Merch store page
  - About us page
  - Term & conditons page
- Stakeholder portal features:
  - WIP tracks for stakeholder suggestion, or critic UI. But it shouldn't override the artist's creative direction.
  - Contact messages across all platforms; from email through IMAP & the "Contact us" form from the end-user interface. 
  - Share sale information & share DEX
  - Proposal channel & broadcaster UI where shareholder can give suggestions & receive other suggestions from other proposing stakeholders to be voted upon but not DAO style with tokens.
